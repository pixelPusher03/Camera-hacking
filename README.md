# Camera-hacking
A Proof-of-Concept
Understanding the Vulnerability
This repository demonstrates a common vulnerability found in many internet-connected cameras. Insecure default configurations, weak authentication mechanisms, and lack of regular updates can leave these devices susceptible to exploitation.

<h3> Run Command: </h3>

```
* apt-get install python3
```
```
* apt-get install git
```
```
* git clone https://github.com/pixelPusher03/Camera-Hacking
```
```
* cd Camera-Hacking
```
```
* pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
* python3 cam-hackers.py 
```
## Prerequisites
 * Target Camera: An internet-connected camera with known vulnerabilities.
 * Basic Networking Knowledge: Understanding of IP addresses, ports, and network protocols.
 * Ethical Hacking Tools: Tools like Nmap, Metasploit, or specialized camera hacking tools.
Steps Involved
 * Information Gathering:
   * Identify the camera's IP address using network scanning tools like Nmap.
   * Discover open ports and services running on the camera.
   * Research the camera's model and firmware for known vulnerabilities.
 * Exploit Identification:
   * Look for common vulnerabilities like default passwords, weak encryption, or outdated firmware.
   * Use vulnerability databases or security advisories to find specific exploits.
 * Exploit Execution:
   * Utilize specialized tools or scripts to exploit the identified vulnerabilities.
   * This may involve brute-forcing passwords, injecting malicious code, or bypassing authentication mechanisms.
